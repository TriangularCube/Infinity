- Gutted the entire script system

September 2, 2014
- Moved Camera controls to the individual ship controls. Deleted CameraFollow.
- Separated all ship controls into proper folders. Now all ship control inherits from <ShipControl> to make it easier to find.
- Separated PlayerManager into PlayersManager and PlayerTerminal
- <Stats> now carry an extra field indicating which type of ship this is
- Player Focus split into Focus and Role. Folded into a struct.
- Fixed Observation camera rotation. Can no longer rotate around Z axis. Y axis rotation constrained around the ship's (and not player's) Y axis.
	- Bug: This still allows upside-down rotation.

TODO
- Should probably fold <Stats> into a struct too
- Camera transistion between focuses needs to be dealt with somewhere. Haven't figured out where.

- Added (in theory) network functionality to PlayerManager


August 25, 2014
- Reorganized Prefabs. Centralized stats into the Stats script
- Added attitude control code
- Added preliminary cursor lock and unlock code
- Started PlayerManager code
	- Will now spawn a Fighter for the player upon entering the scene
	- Will lock cursor upon entering the scene
- Started function to change focus of the player. Will need to add AI script cohesion later
- Moved input functions over to Unity's input manager
	- Might have to implement my own input manager later
- Six axis of thrust vectors implemented
- Yaw, Pitch and Roll implemented (though roll could probably use some more work)

TODO
- Fire Control
- Rudimentary Multi-player

- Moved movement code to FixedUpdate for better physics control.
